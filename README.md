## Summary:
### Intoduction:
  This repository is for our preprint["Tongue Size and Shape Classification Fusing Segmentation Features for Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354694326_Tongue_Size_and_Shape_Classification_Fusing_Segmentation_Features_for_Traditional_Chinese_Medicine_Diagnosis)
  
### Framework:
![](https://github.com/Yating-Huang/TU-Net/blob/main/TU-Net.png)

## Usage:
### Requirement:
Ubuntu 16.04+pycharm+python3.6+pytorch1.7.1  
### Preprocessing:
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Yating-Huang/TSC-WNet.git
cd TU-Net
```
## HOW TO RUN:
The only thing you should do is enter the data/image.txt and correct the path of the datasets.
then run ~
example:
```
---classification---
python kfold_class.py 
---segmentation---
python kfold_seg.py 
```
## RESULTS
after train and test,3 folders will be created,they are "result","saved_model","saved_predict".

### best_model folder:
After training,the saved model is in this folder.

### result folder:
in result folder,there are the logs and the line chart of metrics.such as:

### saved_predict folder:
in this folder,there are the ouput predict of the saved model,such as:
